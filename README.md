# Shotz!

It's a new beginning, the beginning of promises. In this website of two parts, we were instructed to create a website that showed a set of movies and where they had been shot. At first there was one, then two more movies were added on individual cards with information regarding it's description, title, genre and estimated release date. In addition to the movies, locations were added on cards below. From four to however many chosen, different locations were printed with their image, location and shoot time. As well, the relevance to the movie.```

- As a user, I have successfully completed my first movie and am filming a lot more. I need to update my app to track all of the various locations for all my movies.
- Upon arriving at the homepage, I should see a section of cards with information on my movies (it should display all of them).
- Each movie card should contain the name, genre, estimated release date, description, and the number of shooting locations.
- Upon arriving at the homepage, I should see a list of ALL locations that ALL of my movies need, displayed as cards.
- Each location card should show the image, name, address, shoot time, and number of movies that use that location.
- As a user, I should be displayed a search bar. This search bar should filter the results of the cards. On keypress, the text I type in the search bar should be contained in the location title text, the location address, or one of the movie names of all cards still displayed.
- As a user, I should be displayed 4 button options for "time of day." (Options: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, After Dark). These buttons should filter the results down to each location that has a "Time That shot should occur" corresponding to the button clicked.

- As a user, when I click on one of the movie cards, the DOM is completely rewritten (as though I am on a new page). This new DOM should have the info for the single movie I clicked on, cards for the locations for the movie I am currently viewing, and a back button.
- If I click on the back button, I should then be viewing "All Locations/movies View"
